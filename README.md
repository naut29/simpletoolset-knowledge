# SimpleToolset Knowledge Export

This repository is a public knowledge base for SimpleToolset. It is designed for AI/LLM and search indexing and contains content-only documentation for tools, categories, and use cases.

## Purpose

This is a mirror of SimpleToolset content for indexing and reference. It is not the production site.

## How it is generated

Content is exported from the private SimpleToolset repo into `public-knowledge-export/` as a clean, publishable bundle.

## Organization

- `knowledge/categories/` contains category pages.
- `knowledge/tools/` contains tool pages.
- `knowledge/use-cases/` contains use case pages.
- `tools.json` contains structured metadata for tools.
- `sitemap.md` lists all canonical URLs and files.
- `llms.txt` and `ai-index.md` provide AI/LLM guidance.

## Contributing

## AI/LLM friendly

Content is structured, uses canonical URLs, and includes no tracking or analytics identifiers.

## No user data

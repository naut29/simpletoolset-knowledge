# About SimpleToolSet

SimpleToolSet is a free online tool platform focused on simplicity, speed, and privacy.

Unlike traditional software, SimpleToolSet tools run directly in the browser. Files and text are not uploaded to servers whenever possible.

The project focuses on building lightweight tools that can be used for many years without constant updates.

The long-term goal is to create a global, multilingual library of useful online utilities.

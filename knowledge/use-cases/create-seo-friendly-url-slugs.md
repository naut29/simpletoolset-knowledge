# Create SEO-Friendly URL Slugs

## Overview

Consistent slugs make URLs easier to scan and share. This guide shows a simple workflow to generate clean, keyword-focused slugs without extra noise.

## Key features

- Generate lowercase, hyphenated slugs
- Spot overused keywords quickly
- Normalize casing and spacing
- Keep URLs within length targets

## How to use

1. Start with your working title and remove unnecessary filler words.
2. Generate a slug and normalize casing for consistency across pages.
3. Review keyword frequency and shorten the slug if it feels too long.

## FAQs

- Should slugs match titles exactly?: Not always. Shorter slugs that keep the main keyword are often better.
- Is it okay to use numbers in slugs?: Yes, if numbers add clarity such as versions or list counts.

# Convert Screenshots into a Single PDF

## Overview

Screenshots are easy to capture but hard to share as a set. This workflow combines them into a clean PDF that reads in order.

## Key features

- Combine multiple images into one PDF
- Reorder pages for a clean narrative
- Fix rotated screenshots quickly
- Resize images for consistent page fit

## How to use

1. Resize or crop screenshots so they match a consistent size.
2. Convert images to PDF and merge into the final order.
3. Rotate any pages that display sideways.

## FAQs

- Can I mix different image sizes?: Yes, but consistent sizing looks cleaner.
- Does merging change image quality?: No, the PDF preserves the image data you provide.

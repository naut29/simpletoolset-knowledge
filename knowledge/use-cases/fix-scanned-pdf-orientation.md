# Fix Scanned PDF Orientation Issues

## Overview

Scanners often capture pages sideways or upside down. This workflow helps you rotate pages, clean up scans, and rebuild the PDF in the correct order.

## Key features

- Rotate pages in bulk
- Convert pages to images for quick cleanup
- Rebuild clean PDFs after edits
- Merge multiple scans into one file

## How to use

1. Rotate the PDF so pages display upright.
2. Convert pages to images if you need quick edits or cleanup.
3. Rebuild the PDF and merge scanned batches as needed.

## FAQs

- Will rotation affect page quality?: No, rotation only changes orientation.
- Can I fix multiple PDFs at once?: Yes, process each batch then merge.

# Compare Document Versions

## Overview

When multiple drafts circulate, small edits can slip through. This workflow highlights changes, cleans formatting, and verifies counts before sharing the final copy.

## Key features

- Highlight additions and removals quickly
- Normalize whitespace for fair comparisons
- Sort lines to compare unordered lists
- Validate total word counts

## How to use

1. Paste both drafts into the diff tool to highlight edits.
2. Normalize line breaks and sort lists if order is not important.
3. Check word counts to confirm nothing major was lost.

## FAQs

- Can I compare large blocks of text?: Yes, the diff tool handles long content well.
- Does sorting change the text?: Sorting only changes order, not the words themselves.

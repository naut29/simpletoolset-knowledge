# Compress Images for Web Performance

## Overview

Large images are one of the biggest causes of slow page loads. This guide shows how to shrink image size while keeping quality, and links to tools that do the work in your browser.


## Key features

- Hero images: target < 200 KB when possible
- Content images: target < 120 KB
- Thumbnails/icons: target < 30 KB
- WebP: best all-around compression
- JPEG: good for photos
- PNG: use only when transparency is required
- Use a predictable workflow

## How to use

1. When to compress images: Compress any image above ~150 KB that appears above the fold, in galleries, or in content that loads on every page. For decorative elements, aim even smaller.
2. Pick the right format: Modern formats like WebP reduce size significantly. If you need transparency, WebP or PNG are good options. JPEG is still fine for photos when WebP is not supported.
3. Use a predictable workflow: Resize first, then compress. Upload the image at the smallest visible dimensions before running compression to avoid wasting bytes.

## FAQs

- Will compression hurt image quality?: High-quality compression removes data that is hard to notice visually. You can keep the quality slider higher for critical images and still reduce size meaningfully.
- Is WebP safe for SEO?: Yes. WebP is supported by modern browsers and is recommended for performance. Faster pages generally improve SEO outcomes.

# Build Trackable Campaign Links

## Overview

Campaign tracking depends on consistent URLs. This workflow creates tagged links, verifies parameters, and produces QR codes when needed.

## Key features

- Build UTM-tagged URLs quickly
- Validate query parameters for accuracy
- Generate QR codes for offline channels
- Keep naming consistent across campaigns

## How to use

1. Create a UTM-tagged URL with your campaign details.
2. Parse the URL to confirm parameters and structure.
3. Generate a QR code for print or in-person sharing.

## FAQs

- Should I reuse UTM values across channels?: Use consistent naming but keep source and medium specific.
- Do QR codes affect tracking?: No, they simply encode the same URL.

# Merge, Split, and Rotate PDF Files Online

## Overview

If your PDF files are out of order or too large, you can reorganize them in minutes. These tools run locally in your browser to keep files private.


## Key features

- Merge PDFs to simplify sharing
- Split large PDFs into smaller files
- Rotate pages that scanned sideways

## How to use

1. Merge PDFs to simplify sharing: Combine multiple PDFs into one when you need to send a single file. This is helpful for proposals, reports, or multi-part documents.
2. Split large PDFs into smaller files: Split by page to make files easier to upload, email, or organize. This is ideal for compliance and archiving workflows.
3. Rotate pages that scanned sideways: Rotate all pages in one go to fix orientation issues without re-scanning.

## FAQs

- Do these tools upload my PDFs?: No. All processing runs locally in your browser, so your files stay on your device.
- Can I merge PDFs with different page sizes?: Yes. The tools preserve each page size within the combined document.

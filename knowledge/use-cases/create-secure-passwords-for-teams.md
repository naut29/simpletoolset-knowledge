# Create Secure Passwords for Teams

## Overview

Shared tools still need strong credentials. This workflow creates strong passwords, checks strength, and generates IDs for tracking.

## Key features

- Generate strong random passwords
- Check strength before rollout
- Create unique IDs for access records
- Generate PIN-style numbers when needed

## How to use

1. Generate a strong password with the desired length and character mix.
2. Run the password through the strength checker for validation.
3. Create unique IDs or PINs for tracking and audits.

## FAQs

- Should every team use the same password?: No, use unique credentials per person or system.
- Are longer passwords always better?: Length helps, but mix character types too.

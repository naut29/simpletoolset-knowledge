# Reduce Image Size Without Losing Quality

## Overview

If your images are too large, you don't need to sacrifice clarity to make them smaller. With the right format and compression level, you can shrink file size while keeping text sharp and photos natural.


## Key features

- Use lossless when you need perfect fidelity (logos, some graphics)
- Use high-quality lossy for photos and most website images
- Always preview results for text-heavy screenshots
- WebP: smaller files at similar quality
- JPEG: good for photos, widely supported
- PNG: use mainly for transparency
- A simple workflow that works

## How to use

1. Lossy vs lossless compression: Lossless compression keeps every pixel the same but usually saves less space. Lossy compression removes data that's hard to notice visually and often reduces size much more. For most web and social images, high-quality lossy compression is the best trade-off.
2. Choose the right format first: Format selection can reduce size more than compression alone. WebP is usually the best default. JPEG works well for photos when WebP isn't an option. PNG is best reserved for transparency or very simple graphics.
3. A simple workflow that works: Resize to the actual display size first, then compress. If you're publishing on a website, keep hero images lightweight and compress everything else aggressively. For social media, resize to the platform's dimensions, then compress to avoid double-compression artifacts.

## FAQs

- How much can I reduce an image without losing quality?: Often 30-70% smaller is possible with high-quality compression, depending on the original image. Photos usually compress more than screenshots or images with lots of text.
- Why do my images look blurry after compression?: Blurriness typically comes from compressing too aggressively or resizing after compression. Resize first, keep quality higher for text-heavy images, and consider WebP for better results at smaller sizes.
- Is it better to convert to WebP or just compress JPEG/PNG?: Converting to WebP usually gives the biggest savings while keeping quality. If your workflow requires JPEG/PNG, you can still compress those formats and get meaningful improvements.

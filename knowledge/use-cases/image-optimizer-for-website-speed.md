# Image Optimizer for Website Speed (Improve Core Web Vitals)

## Overview

Images are usually the biggest files on a webpage. If they're not optimized, they delay loading, hurt Core Web Vitals, and can reduce conversions. A good image optimization process is simple: use the right dimensions, pick an efficient format, and compress without visible quality loss.


## Key features

- Reduce image file sizes to improve LCP
- Use proper dimensions to avoid wasted bytes
- Set width/height (or aspect ratio) to prevent CLS
- Resize to actual display size
- Compress to reduce transfer size
- Prefer WebP for most website images
- Prioritize above-the-fold images first
- A simple workflow you can repeat

## How to use

1. How images affect Core Web Vitals: Large images slow down the first meaningful paint and can increase LCP. Unspecified image sizes can also cause layout shifts (CLS). Optimizing image weight and dimensions is one of the fastest ways to improve real-world performance.
2. A practical optimization checklist: Start with the images that appear above the fold and on high-traffic pages. Resize them to the display dimensions, compress them, and prefer modern formats like WebP when possible. Keep decorative images very small.
3. A simple workflow you can repeat: Use an image resizer to match your layout, compress for file size, and optionally convert to WebP. For teams, document your target sizes (hero, content, thumbnails) so everyone produces consistent outputs.

## FAQs

- What is a good target file size for website images?: It depends on the layout, but a common goal is: hero images under ~200 KB, content images under ~120 KB, and thumbnails under ~30 KB when possible.
- Does image optimization help SEO?: Yes. Faster pages improve user experience and Core Web Vitals, which are performance signals that can support better SEO outcomes over time.
- Should I convert everything to WebP?: For most websites, yes-WebP provides excellent compression. Keep PNG when you specifically need transparency or if your workflow requires it.

# Convert and Compress Images to WebP Online

## Overview

WebP is a modern image format developed by Google that provides significantly smaller file sizes than JPG and PNG at similar visual quality. Converting and compressing images to WebP helps websites load faster, reduces bandwidth usage, and improves overall performance.


## Key features

- Smaller files at comparable quality
- Supports transparency like PNG
- Well supported by modern browsers
- Hero and content images on websites
- Ecommerce product galleries
- Blogs and media-heavy pages
- A practical WebP optimization workflow

## How to use

1. Why WebP is better for websites: WebP supports both lossy and lossless compression, transparency, and even animation. In most real-world tests, WebP images are 25-35% smaller than equivalent JPG or PNG files while maintaining similar visual quality.
2. When you should convert images to WebP: WebP is ideal for photos, product images, blog images, and most website graphics. It is especially useful for pages with many images, such as ecommerce categories, portfolios, and landing pages where speed is critical.
3. A practical WebP optimization workflow: Start by resizing images to their display dimensions. Convert them to WebP, then apply compression to balance size and quality. Always preview a few examples to ensure text and edges remain sharp.

# Generate Favicons and Web App Icons

## Overview

A consistent icon set keeps your brand recognizable across tabs, bookmarks, and device shortcuts. This workflow covers the basics.

## Key features

- Create favicon sizes from one source
- Check aspect ratios before resizing
- Generate base64 strings for inline usage
- Convert to WebP when needed

## How to use

1. Start with a square master image and generate favicon sizes.
2. Verify aspect ratio and resize assets for app icons.
3. Convert or embed icons as needed for your build.

## FAQs

- Do I need a separate favicon for each browser?: Not always, but multiple sizes improve coverage.
- Is WebP okay for icons?: Yes, but keep PNG for broader compatibility.

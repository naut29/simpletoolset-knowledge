## FAQs

- What image formats are supported?: Our tools support JPEG, PNG, and WebP formats. Some tools output specific formats optimized for their purpose.
- Is there a file size limit?: There's no strict limit, but very large images may process slowly depending on your device. We recommend images under 50MB for best performance.
- Are my images uploaded to your servers?: No. All image processing happens entirely in your browser using JavaScript. Your images never leave your device.

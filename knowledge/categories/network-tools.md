## FAQs

- Is IP lookup accurate?: IP geolocation is generally accurate at the city or region level. Exact addresses cannot be determined from IP addresses alone.
- Can I look up any IP address?: Yes, you can look up any public IP address. Private/internal IPs (like 192.168.x.x) cannot be geolocated.
- How does URL parsing work?: URL parsing breaks down a URL into its components: protocol, host, port, path, query parameters, and fragment. This is done entirely in your browser.

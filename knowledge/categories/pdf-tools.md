## FAQs

- Can I edit text inside PDFs?: Our current tools focus on page-level operations (merge, split, rotate) and format conversion. Direct text editing requires different technology.
- Do these tools work with scanned PDFs?: Yes, our tools work with all PDF types including scanned documents. The content is processed exactly as it appears in the original.
- Is there a page limit for PDFs?: There's no strict limit, but very large PDFs may take longer to process. For best performance, we recommend PDFs under 50 pages or 50MB.

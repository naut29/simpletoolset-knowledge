## FAQs

- Are the random numbers truly random?: Yes, our generators use the Web Crypto API for cryptographically secure randomness. The numbers are as random as computationally possible.
- What can I use QR codes for?: QR codes can encode URLs, plain text, contact information, WiFi credentials, and more. They're perfect for marketing materials, business cards, and quick information sharing.
- What is a UUID?: A UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) is a 128-bit identifier used in software development. UUID v4 uses random numbers, making duplicates virtually impossible.

## FAQs

- Where do I put the .htaccess file?: Place the .htaccess file in your website's root directory (usually public_html or www). It affects that directory and all subdirectories.
- Why aren't my rules working?: Ensure your server has mod_rewrite enabled and that AllowOverride is set to All in your Apache configuration. Contact your host if needed.
- Can .htaccess slow down my site?: Minimally. Apache parses .htaccess on every request, but the impact is negligible for most sites. For high-traffic sites, consider adding rules to httpd.conf instead.
- Is .htaccess secure?: Yes, .htaccess files are not accessible to web visitors by default. Apache blocks direct access to files starting with .ht

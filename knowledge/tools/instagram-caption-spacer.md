## FAQs

- Why doesn't Instagram keep my line breaks?: Instagram removes multiple line breaks and trailing spaces. Our tool uses special invisible characters that Instagram preserves, maintaining your formatting.
- Does this work for Instagram bios?: Yes! The same technique works for bios, letting you create clean, organized profile descriptions with proper spacing.
- Will the spacing look weird?: No, the spacing looks completely natural. The invisible characters are truly invisible - viewers just see clean line breaks.
- Does this work for other platforms?: This tool is optimized for Instagram. Other platforms like Twitter and Facebook generally preserve line breaks normally.

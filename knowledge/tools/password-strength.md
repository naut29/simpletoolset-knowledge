## FAQs

- Is my password stored or transmitted?: No, analysis happens 100% in your browser. Your password never leaves your device and is never stored or transmitted.
- How is crack time estimated?: We estimate based on password entropy, character sets used, length, and common attack patterns. This assumes modern attack hardware.
- What makes a password strong?: Strong passwords are long (12+ characters), use mixed character types, avoid dictionary words and patterns, and are unique to each account.
- Should I use a password manager?: Yes! Password managers let you use unique, complex passwords for every account without memorizing them. They're highly recommended.

## FAQs

- How does the sorting work with numbers?: Numbers are sorted alphabetically (1, 10, 2 instead of 1, 2, 10). For numerical sorting, consider using a spreadsheet application.
- Is the sorting case-sensitive?: No, our sorter treats uppercase and lowercase letters equally. 'Apple' and 'apple' will be sorted together based on their letters, not their case.
- Can I sort CSV or spreadsheet data?: While you can paste CSV data, the sorter treats each line as one unit. For column-based sorting, use a dedicated spreadsheet tool.
- What happens to duplicate lines?: Duplicate lines are preserved in the output. If you want to remove duplicates, use our Remove Duplicate Lines tool first, then sort.

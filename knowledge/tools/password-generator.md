## FAQs

- How secure are these passwords?: Our generator uses the Web Crypto API for cryptographically secure randomness. The passwords generated are truly random and cannot be predicted, making them extremely secure.
- What makes a password strong?: Strong passwords are long (12+ characters), contain a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols, and don't contain dictionary words or personal information.
- Are my generated passwords stored anywhere?: No. Password generation happens entirely in your browser. We never see, store, or transmit your passwords. Your security is 100% private.
- How often should I change my passwords?: Security experts now recommend changing passwords only when there's evidence of a breach. Focus on using unique, strong passwords for each account and enable two-factor authentication where possible.

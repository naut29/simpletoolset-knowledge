## FAQs

- What is aspect ratio and why lock it?: Aspect ratio is the proportional relationship between width and height. Locking it ensures your image doesn't become stretched or squished when resizing.
- Can I make an image larger?: Yes, but enlarging images may result in some quality loss. For best results, avoid enlarging images more than 2x their original size.
- What presets are available?: We include common presets for social media (Instagram, Facebook, Twitter), web standards, and print sizes. Check the preset buttons for all options.
- Does resizing affect image quality?: Reducing size maintains quality well. Enlarging can cause pixelation. We use bicubic interpolation for the best possible quality during resizing.

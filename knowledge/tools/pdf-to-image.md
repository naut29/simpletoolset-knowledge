## FAQs

- What's the difference between JPG and PNG output?: JPG files are smaller but use lossy compression. PNG files are larger but lossless, preserving exact quality. Use PNG for text-heavy pages and JPG for photos.
- What resolution are the output images?: Images are generated at high resolution suitable for most uses. The quality matches the original PDF page resolution.
- Can I convert password-protected PDFs?: No, password-protected PDFs cannot be converted. You'll need to remove the password protection first using appropriate software.
- Is there a page limit?: There's no strict limit, but very long PDFs may take longer to process. For best performance, we recommend PDFs under 50 pages.

## FAQs

- What is Unix epoch time?: Unix epoch is the number of seconds (or milliseconds) that have elapsed since January 1, 1970 at 00:00:00 UTC. It's a standard way computers represent time.
- Why do some timestamps have 10 digits and others 13?: 10-digit timestamps are in seconds, 13-digit are in milliseconds. JavaScript typically uses milliseconds, while Unix systems often use seconds.
- How do I know which format to use?: Check your API documentation. Modern JavaScript uses milliseconds (Date.now()), while many server systems use seconds (time()).
- Does this handle timezones?: Epoch time is always UTC. The converter shows local time but the underlying epoch value is timezone-independent.

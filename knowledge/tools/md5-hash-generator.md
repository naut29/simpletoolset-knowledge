# MD5 Hash Generator - Free Online MD5 Checksum Tool

## Overview

Generate MD5 checksums for data integrity verification. Convert any text into a 128-bit MD5 hash (32 hexadecimal characters).


## Key features

- Instant MD5 hash generation
- Handles any text input including Unicode
- One-click copy to clipboard
- 32-character hexadecimal output
- 100% client-side processing
- No data sent to servers

## How to use

1. Enter or paste text in the input field
2. Click Generate MD5 Hash button
3. Copy the resulting 32-character hash
4. Use the hash for checksums or data verification
5. Clear and generate new hashes as needed

## FAQs

- Is MD5 secure for passwords?: No, MD5 is cryptographically broken and should NOT be used for password hashing or security purposes. Use SHA-256 or bcrypt for security applications.
- What is an MD5 hash used for?: MD5 hashes are commonly used for checksums to verify file integrity, detect duplicate files, and create unique identifiers. They should only be used for non-security purposes.
- Will the same text always produce the same hash?: Yes, MD5 is deterministic. The same input will always produce the exact same 32-character hash output.
- Can I reverse an MD5 hash to get the original text?: No, MD5 is a one-way hash function. You cannot mathematically reverse it. However, common strings can be found via lookup tables, which is why MD5 is insecure.

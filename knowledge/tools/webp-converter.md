## FAQs

- Why would I need to convert WebP?: Some older software, email clients, and platforms don't support WebP. Converting ensures your images work everywhere.
- Should I choose PNG or JPG?: Use PNG for images with transparency or graphics. Use JPG for photographs where smaller file size matters more than perfect quality.
- Is quality lost during conversion?: Converting to PNG is lossless. Converting to JPG involves some quality loss, but you can control it with the quality slider.

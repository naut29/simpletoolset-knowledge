## FAQs

- What aspect ratios are available?: We offer common ratios like 1:1 (square), 16:9 (widescreen), 4:3 (standard), 3:2 (photo), and 9:16 (portrait/stories). You can also crop freely without ratio restrictions.
- Can I crop the same image multiple times?: Yes, you can crop multiple times. However, for best quality, we recommend cropping from the original image rather than a previously cropped version.
- Is there a minimum crop size?: There's no strict minimum, but very small crops from large images may result in low resolution. We recommend keeping your crop area reasonably sized for usable output.
- Does cropping reduce image quality?: Cropping itself doesn't reduce quality - you're simply selecting a portion of the existing image. However, if you crop a very small area and enlarge it, quality may decrease.

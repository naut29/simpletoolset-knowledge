## FAQs

- Why use Base64 images?: Base64 allows embedding images directly in HTML/CSS, eliminating separate image requests. Great for small icons, email templates, and self-contained files.
- Does Base64 increase file size?: Yes, Base64 encoding increases size by about 33%. It's best for small images. Large images should use traditional file hosting.
- What's a Data URI?: A Data URI is a URL scheme that includes the file data inline, like 'data:image/png;base64,...'. It lets browsers render the image without fetching it.
- When should I avoid Base64 images?: Avoid for images over 10KB, as caching is lost and HTML size increases. Use for small icons, email templates, and reducing initial HTTP requests.

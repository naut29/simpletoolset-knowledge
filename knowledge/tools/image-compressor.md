## FAQs

- Will compression affect image quality?: Some quality loss occurs with compression, but it's often imperceptible. Our slider lets you find the right balance - higher quality means larger files, lower quality means smaller files.
- What image formats are supported?: We support JPEG, PNG, and WebP formats. All images are compressed to JPEG format for optimal file size reduction.
- Is there a file size limit for uploads?: There's no strict limit, but very large images may take longer to process. We recommend images under 50MB for best performance.
- Is my image uploaded to a server?: No. All compression happens locally in your browser. Your images never leave your device, ensuring complete privacy.

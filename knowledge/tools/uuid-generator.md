## FAQs

- What is a UUID?: UUID stands for Universally Unique Identifier. It's a 128-bit number used to identify information in computer systems. UUID v4 uses random numbers, making collisions extremely improbable.
- Will UUIDs ever repeat?: Practically, no. The probability of generating duplicate UUID v4s is astronomically low - you'd need to generate billions per second for centuries to have a 50% chance of one collision.
- What's the difference between UUID and GUID?: They're essentially the same thing. GUID (Globally Unique Identifier) is Microsoft's term for the same concept. Both follow the same format and specifications.
- Should I use uppercase or lowercase?: Both are valid and equivalent. Lowercase is more common in modern systems, but choose based on your project's conventions. UUIDs are case-insensitive by specification.

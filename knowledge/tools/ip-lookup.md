## FAQs

- How accurate is IP geolocation?: Generally accurate to city level (within 25-50 miles). Exact street addresses cannot be determined from IP addresses alone.
- Can I lookup any IP address?: You can lookup any public IP address. Private/internal IPs (like 192.168.x.x or 10.x.x.x) are not geolocatable.
- Why does my location show differently?: ISPs sometimes route traffic through data centers in different cities. VPNs and proxies will show the server location instead.
- Is my IP lookup private?: IP lookups are performed using a third-party geolocation API. Review our privacy notice for details on data handling.

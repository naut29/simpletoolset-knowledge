## FAQs

- What is a good contrast ratio?: WCAG AA requires 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text. AAA requires 7:1 for normal text and 4.5:1 for large text.
- What counts as large text?: Large text is 18pt (24px) or larger, or 14pt (18.66px) if bold. Large text has lower contrast requirements.
- Is AA or AAA better?: AAA is stricter and provides better accessibility. AA is the minimum legal requirement in many jurisdictions. Aim for AA at minimum.
- Does this work for colorblind users?: Contrast ratios help all users including those with color vision deficiencies. However, also avoid relying solely on color to convey information.

## FAQs

- Are the numbers truly random?: Yes, we use the Web Crypto API which provides cryptographically secure random number generation. The numbers are as random as computationally possible.
- Can I generate numbers without duplicates?: Yes, toggle off 'Allow Duplicates' to ensure each number appears only once. Note that the count cannot exceed the range size when duplicates are disabled.
- What's the maximum range I can use?: You can use any integer range within JavaScript's safe integer limits (9 quadrillion). For practical purposes, any reasonable range works perfectly.
- Can I use this for gambling or lotteries?: While our generator is cryptographically secure, official lotteries and gambling have their own regulated random number systems. Use this for personal, non-official purposes.

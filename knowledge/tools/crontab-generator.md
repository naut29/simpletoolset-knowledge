## FAQs

- What format does this generate?: Standard 5-field crontab format: minute hour day month weekday. This works with most Unix/Linux systems and cron-compatible schedulers.
- What does * mean in cron?: The asterisk (*) means 'every' - so * in the hour field means every hour. You can also use ranges (1-5) and lists (1,3,5).
- How do I schedule something every 5 minutes?: Use */5 in the minute field to run every 5 minutes. The generator has presets for common intervals like this.
- Does this work with AWS/Azure/Kubernetes?: The 5-field format works with most schedulers. Some platforms like AWS use 6-field format (with seconds) which you may need to adapt.

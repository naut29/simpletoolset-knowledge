## FAQs

- What image should I upload?: Use a square PNG or JPG image. Higher resolution (512x512 or larger) gives the best results when scaling down to smaller sizes.
- What favicon sizes do I need?: At minimum: 16x16 and 32x32 for browsers, 180x180 for Apple devices, and 192x192 for Android. Our generator creates all standard sizes.
- How do I add favicons to my website?: Copy the generated HTML code to your website's <head> section. Place the favicon files in your root directory or adjust paths as needed.
- Why isn't my favicon showing?: Clear your browser cache (Ctrl+F5). Favicons are heavily cached. Also ensure the HTML links are correct and files are accessible.

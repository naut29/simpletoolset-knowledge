## FAQs

- Can I extract just one page?: Yes, you can extract a single page or any range of pages you specify. The extracted content becomes a new, separate PDF file.
- What happens to the original PDF?: The original PDF is not modified. Splitting creates new PDF files from copies of the selected pages.
- Can I split encrypted PDFs?: No, password-protected PDFs cannot be split. You'll need to unlock the PDF first before splitting.
- How are the split files named?: Split files are typically named with the original filename plus a page number or range indicator for easy identification.

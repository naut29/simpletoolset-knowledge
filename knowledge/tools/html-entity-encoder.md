## FAQs

- What characters need encoding?: Characters like < > & " ' have special meaning in HTML and should be encoded to &lt; &gt; &amp; &quot; &#39; respectively.
- Why encode HTML entities?: Encoding prevents browsers from interpreting text as HTML code, avoiding display issues and security vulnerabilities like XSS attacks.
- What's the difference between named and numeric entities?: Named entities use words (&amp;) while numeric use code points (&#38;). Both represent the same character but named are more readable.
- Does this encode all Unicode characters?: The tool encodes HTML-sensitive characters. Unicode characters are preserved unless they require encoding for safe HTML display.

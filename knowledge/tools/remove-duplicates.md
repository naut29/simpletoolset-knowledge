# Remove Duplicate Lines - Free Online Dedupe Tool

## FAQs

- What does case-insensitive matching mean?: When enabled, 'Hello' and 'hello' are treated as duplicates. When disabled, they're treated as unique lines due to different capitalization.
- How does whitespace trimming work?: Whitespace trimming removes leading and trailing spaces from each line before comparing. This catches duplicates that only differ by extra spaces.
- Which duplicate is kept - first or last occurrence?: The first occurrence of each unique line is preserved, and subsequent duplicates are removed. The order of unique lines is maintained.
- Is there a limit to how much text I can process?: There's no hard limit. The tool works in your browser, so very large texts (millions of lines) may slow down depending on your device's memory.

## FAQs

- What can I put in a QR code?: QR codes can contain URLs, plain text, contact cards (vCard), WiFi credentials, phone numbers, emails, and more. The most common use is encoding URLs.
- How long does a QR code last?: QR codes don't expire - they contain the data directly. However, if your QR code links to a URL, the code stops working if that URL becomes unavailable.
- What's the maximum data a QR code can hold?: QR codes can hold up to about 3,000 characters, but shorter content creates simpler, more easily scannable codes. Keep content concise for best results.
- Will my QR code work on all phones?: Yes, modern smartphones can scan QR codes with their camera app. Older phones may need a dedicated QR scanner app.
